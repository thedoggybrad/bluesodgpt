# BlueSodGPT
All right! Windows' Blue Screen of Death has been ported to ChatGPT, so that you will not need to sacrifice your Windows machine just messing up with the Windows Registry, just kidding.

## Demo
Try BlueSodGPT [thedoggybrad.github.io/bluesodgpt/](https://thedoggybrad.github.io/bluesodgpt/)
<br>
Enjoy the nightmare that Windows BSOD delivered to your life, now in a chat format.

## What is this?
The "BlueSodGPT"" is a clone of "DogGPT" that is a fork of the popular "CatGPT".

## Game Over Screen
To add more suspense to the users, a new Game Over screen was added where at random times the GUI will declare a no bootable device found error. That is randomly timed and try to even just interact with the chatbot before it shows up.<br><br>
Dedication: This feature was added on December 24, 2024 (PhST) as a Christmas surprise gift by TheDoggyBrad Software Labs to the user of the software.

Note: No Artificial Intelligence (AI) was really used. It just uses some sorts of randomizers running under JavaScript.
