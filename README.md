# DogGPT
All right! Windows' Blue Screen of Death has been ported to ChatGPT, so that you will not need to sacrifice your Windows machine just messing up with the Windows Registry, just kidding.

## Demo
Try BlueSodGPT [thedoggybrad.github.io/bluesodgpt/](https://thedoggybrad.github.io/bluesodgpt/)
<br>
Enjoy the nightmare that Windows BSOD delivered to your life, now in a chat format.

Note: No Artificial Intelligence (AI) was really used. It just uses some sorts of randomizers running under JavaScript.
